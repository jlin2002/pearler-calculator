# Description

This calculator is a comparison tool, targeted at users who are unsure about investing. It asks them how they would allocate $10,000 between a savings account and stock investing. It also asks users to select a time horizon for their decision.

This calculator determines the expected value and annual percentage return of the user's decision (in both nominal and inflation-adjusted terms). It also provides a risk metric (standard deviation of returns), which is determined by time horizon and allocation between bank savings and stocks.
